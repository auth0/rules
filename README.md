Rules are code snippets written in JavaScript that are executed as part of the authentication pipeline in [Auth0](https://www.auth0.com). This happens every time a user authenticates to an application. __Rules__ enable very powerful customizations and extensions to be easily added to Auth0.

An App initiates an authentication request to Auth0 (__Step 1__), Auth0 routes the request to an Identity Provider through a configured connection (__Step 2__). The user authenticates successfuly (__Step3__), the `user` object that represents the logged in user is then passed through the rules pipeline and returned to the app (__Step 4__).

A rule will run on Step 4 and this is the information each rule will get:

* `user`: the user object as it comes from the identity provider.
* `context`: an object containing contextual information of the current authentication transaction. It has the following properties:
  * `clientID`: the client id of the application the user is logging in to.
  * `client_metadata`: an optional object containing up to 10 key/value pairs
  * `clientName`: the name of the application (as defined on the dashboard).
  * `connection`: the name of the connection used to authenticate the user (e.g.: `twitter` or `some-google-apps-domain`)
  * `connectionStrategy`: the type of connection. For social connection `connectionStrategy` === `connection`. For enterprise connections, the strategy will be `waad` (Windows Azure AD), `ad` (Active Directory/LDAP), `auth0` (database connections), etc.
  * `protocol`: the authentication protocol. Possible values: `oidc-basic-profile` (most used, web based login), `oidc-implicit-profile` (used on mobile devices and single page apps), `oauth2-resource-owner` (user/password login typically used on database connections), `samlp` (SAML protocol used on SaaS apps), `wsfed` (Ws-Federation used on Microsoft products like Office365), `wstrust-usernamemixed` (Ws-trust user/password login used on CRM and Office365)), `delegation` (during the exchange for a delegation token).
  * `request`: an object containing useful information of the request. It has the following properties:
    * `query`: querystring of the login transaction sent by the application
    * `body`: the body of the POST request on login transactions used on `oauth2-resource-owner` or `wstrust-usernamemixed` protocols.
    * `userAgent`: the user-agent of the client that is trying to log in.
    * `ip`: the originating IP address of the user trying to log in.
  * `samlConfiguration`: an object that controls the behavior of the SAML and WS-Fed endpoints. Useful for advanced claims mapping and token enrichment (only available for `samlp` and `wsfed` protocol).
