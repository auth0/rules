 * Check user email domain matches domains configured in connection
 * 
 * This rule will check that the email the user has used to login matches any of the domains configured in a connection. If there are no domains configured, it will allow access.
 * 
 * For example, to setup SAML login, a Fabrikam customer must have a managed domain (claimed and verified by the customer). Fabrikam can then enforce a policy where only users belonging to managed email domains should be able to login via SAML. For example, if the customer Contoso has setup contoso.com as a managed domain, only users with email ending @contoso.com (not @contosocorp.com) should be able to login via SAML.
 * Because Auth0 doesn't enforce this validation OOB - we have to store the valid email domain in connection object (lock already uses this) and then use a rule to validate incoming user's email domain with the one configured on the connection. If email domains doesn't match, the login is denied.
